Finite Element Chebyshev Regularized Stokeslet method. This repository contains code by Hall-McNair and Neal to describe the dynamics of a flexible elastic fiber in (non-Newtonian) low Reynolds number fluid by combining models for an elastic filament (Hall-McNair) using the method of regularized stokeslets and resistive force theory with the three-dimensional finite element method (Neal).
